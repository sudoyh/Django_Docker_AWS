# Feature

1. Django Framework: <br> 
The Django framework's powerful features were utilized to develop an efficient and scalable web application.
<br>

2. Docker Containerization: <br>
Docker was employed to standardize the deployment environment and streamline the deployment process. A Dockerfile was written to containerize the web application, and a Docker image was built based on this Dockerfile.
<br>

3. Amazon EC2 Deployment: <br>
An instance was created on Amazon EC2 to deploy the web application, establishing a stable and flexible deployment environment. Subsequently, the built Docker image was deployed to the EC2 instance.
<br>

4. Domain Connection: <br>
The domain was connected to the public IP address of the assigned EC2 instance, enabling easy access to the web application through a user-friendly domain address.
